Sawtooth 1.1, running poet consensus.
This was a POC of three nodes, the official instruction of sawtooth do not mention the use of the engine. 

I compiled the information from several links.

What is important to have sawtooth 1.1 running.

- You need to include the consensus in the validator. 
	--bind consensus:tcp://127.0.0.1:5050 
- You also need to start the engine. 
	poet-engine -v --connect tcp://127.0.0.1:5050 --component tcp://127.0.0.1:1001 &
 - the first is the port where the engine is running, the second is the port where the validator 	is running.
